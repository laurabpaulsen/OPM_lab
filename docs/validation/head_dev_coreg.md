**WORK IN PROGRESS**


## Aim
The objective is to address two key questions:
1. How many head marks are required to accurately localise the sensor positions relative to the head?
2. Does the placement of these marks affect accuracy - for example, should they be distributed across the head?


## Methods

* Dummy model
* Digitising helmet fiducials -> used to calculate "ground truth" sensor positions -> likely still some errors here due to Polhemus system not being 100 % accurate
* Comparing "ground truth" sensor positions with positions estimated using marks (different numbers and different positions)


## Results
