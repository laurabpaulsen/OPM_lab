# OPM_lab
**OPM_lab** is a free and open source software package developed to allow for co-registration between optically pumped magnetometers and a structural brain image. However, parts of the software may be useful for other purposes.

The workflow contains three main parts:
1. [Digitising sensor positions]({{ site.url }}{% link digitising/index.md %})
2. [Measuring sensor depth]({{ site.url }}{% link measure_depth/index.md %})
3. [Co-registration between MR and sensor positions]({{ site.url }}{% link co-registration/index.md %})
